# Luhn Algorithm Card Validator

This Python project implements the Luhn Algorithm, a checksum formula used to validate credit and debit card numbers. It's a widely used algorithm in payment systems to detect errors or invalid numbers.

## Features
- Validates card numbers using the Luhn Algorithm.
- Supports card number input with or without spaces or dashes.
- Easy-to-read and well-documented Python code.

## How It Works
1. Removes non-numeric characters (e.g., spaces or dashes) from the input card number.
2. Reverses the card number and processes digits based on their position (odd/even).
3. Applies the Luhn checksum logic:
   - Odd-position digits are summed directly.
   - Even-position digits are doubled, and the sum of their digits is added to the total.
4. Determines the validity of the card number based on the final checksum.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/misbah-ullah01/luhn-algorithm-card-validator.git
